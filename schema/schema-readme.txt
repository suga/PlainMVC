Schema directory is used for store YML/XML Doctrine Entities's Metadata files.
By default, PlainMVC uses Annotations as metadata, so, if you keep this default configuration, you can remove schema directory and their subfolders.

If you want to use YML or XML as metadata for Doctrine mapping, please open Library/DoctrineConfig.php for more details and examples on how to do this.
